Project 1: Movie Trailer Website
by Cameron Marsh

This project is part of the Udacity Full Stack Web Development Course. The project will build a website of my favorite movies, showing you on the page a general storyline and main cast. Once you click on the poster, you can view the movie’s trailer.

Required Libraries
- Python 2.7.9 will be required to run this program.

Included in the download:
- media.py
-entertainment_center.py
-fresh_tomatoes.py
- README.tt

Running the Program
1) If necessary, download Python version 2.7.9 from the Python Foundation Website.
2) Download the compressed Movie Trailer Website zip file from above.
3) Go to the terminal of that folder, and run python entertainment_center.py in the command line.

Thanks to:
Thank you to Jon Duckett, author of “HTML & CSS: design and build websites” for his brilliant writing on HTML, enabling me to edit the fresh_tomatoes.py file. 

And thank you to Elle Shwer, who also assisted me in furthering my basic code.
